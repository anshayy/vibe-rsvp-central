tep-by-step guide to get your site live:

Step 1: Get Your Code on GitHub
If your code isn't already in a GitHub repository, this is the first step.

Create a new repository on GitHub.

Follow the instructions on GitHub to "push an existing repository from the command line" to upload your project files.

Step 2: Build Your Project Locally (To Make Sure It Works)
Before deploying, always make sure your site can be built without errors.

Open your terminal in the project's root directory.

Run npm install (or bun install since you have a bun.lockb file) to get all the necessary packages.

Run npm run build (or bun run build).

This will create a new folder named dist in your project. This folder contains the optimized, static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that will actually be deployed. If this step completes without errors, you are ready to deploy.

Step 3: Deploy to Netlify
This is where the magic happens.

Sign up for Netlify: Go to Netlify.com and sign up for a free account, using your GitHub account to log in.

Add a New Site:

In your Netlify dashboard, click "Add new site" -> "Import an existing project".

Choose GitHub as your provider and authorize Netlify to access your repositories.

Select the repository that contains your project files.

Configure Deployment Settings:
Netlify is smart and will probably detect that you have a Vite project. It should automatically fill in the correct settings, but you must verify they are correct. This is the most important part.

Branch to deploy: main (or master, whichever is your primary branch).

Build command: npm run build (or vite build)

Publish directory: dist

Your configuration on Netlify should look exactly like this:

Deploy Site:

Click the "Deploy site" button.

Netlify will pull your code from GitHub, run the npm run build command, and deploy the contents of the dist folder. You can watch the deployment log in real-time.

Step 4: Connect Your Custom Domain
Once the deployment is finished (it usually takes a minute or two), Netlify will give you a random URL like sparkly-cupcake-12345.netlify.app.

Now you can connect your custom domain (todolistandmore.in).

In your Netlify site's dashboard, go to "Domain settings".

Click "Add a domain" and enter your custom domain name.

Netlify will guide you through the process. It will be much easier than with GitHub Pages. Instead of IP addresses, Netlify will likely ask you to go to your domain registrar and change the "Nameservers" to the ones Netlify provides (e.g., dns1.p01.nsone.net). This is generally more reliable than A records.

After you update the nameservers, wait for the DNS to update, and Netlify will automatically provision an SSL certificate for HTTPS.
